( A and B are bf16 numbers ) 
which means mantissa - 7 bits

So mantissa multiplication will be 16 bits because its (1.mmmmmmmm)

1.mmmmmmxxxxxxxx
1.mmmmmmm -> round to nearest even

Result AxB= Some bf16 number

Now we need to add C ( which is a fp32 number )

C is FP32 which means 23 bit mantissa

Above result of AxB - bf16 no.
we pad it with 0 
1.mmmmmmm000000000... -> 23 bit mantissa

now AxB + C -> fp32 
We round it again
